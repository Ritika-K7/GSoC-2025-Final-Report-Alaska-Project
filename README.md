## Project Goal 
The goal of this project is to develop and deliver a highly accurate, automated model that can extract vectorized coastlines directly from PlanetLabs satellite imagery with 3-meter resolution. The work focuses on retraining the DeepWaterMap model, which was originally designed for 30-meter resolution Landsat data, and adapting it to operate effectively on higher-resolution imagery. A custom dataset will be created from PlanetLabs imagery to support this retraining. Ultimately, the project aims to produce a robust model capable of processing large volumes of imagery and accurately predicting coastline changes over time, which is essential for improving coastal erosion forecasts in the Deering region of Alaska, particularly under the impacts of climate change.

## Project Overview ‚Äì What I Did This Summer  

### 1. ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management System  
I added two files to make the project easier to organize and maintain:  

- **`config_template.json`** ‚Äì A single configuration file that stores all file paths and folder structures (satellite images, shapefiles, ground truth data, processed outputs, etc.) in one place.  
- **`load_config.py`** ‚Äì A Python helper module with functions like `get_image_path()`, `get_shapefile_path()`, and `get_raw_data_path()` to quickly access files without hardcoding paths.  

This system avoids hardcoded file paths, so the project is not tied to one person‚Äôs computer setup. Anyone can run the code without needing to manually change paths for their system.  

---

### 2.Utilities Folder (`utils/`)  
I created a `utils/` folder with five reusable modules to support the coastline extraction workflow:  

| **Module** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| `check_crs.py` | Validates and compares CRS of raster/vector files to prevent mismatch errors. |
| `gis_tools.py` | Provides spatial analysis functions like `create_transect_points()` (transect‚Äìcoastline intersections) and `clip_shp()` (shapefile clipping). |
| `rasterize_shapefile.py` | Converts vector coastline shapefiles to raster GeoTIFFs for binary masks used in training/analysis. |
| `shapefile_generator.py` | Creates shapefiles from raster data via morphological active contours, with noise reduction and contour extraction. |
| `spatial_analysis.py` | Offers spatial checks like `log_spatial_info()` to validate raster‚Äìpoint alignment and overlaps. |

These reusable utilities ensure consistency, enable format conversion, support spatial validation, and make the workflow modular and maintainable.  

---

### 3.Fixing the NDWI Labeling Script (`ndwi_labels.py`)  
I enhanced the NDWI labeling script by adding new functions, utility integrations, and automated workflows:  

#### Integration of Utility Modules  
- Imported custom utilities: `check_crs`, `crs_match`, `log_spatial_info`, and `save_concatenated_ndwi_with_shapefile`  
- Integrated the configuration system with `load_config` and path helper functions  

#### Data Validation and Error Prevention  
- Added CRS validation using `check_crs()`  
- Ensured coordinate system compatibility with `crs_match()`  
- Used `log_spatial_info()` to validate data alignment and overlap  

#### Robust Spatial Processing  
- Added intersection checking with `buffer.intersects(raster_bounds_geom)` to prevent processing points outside the raster bounds.  
- Added proper bounds handling by retrieving `raster_bounds` inside the raster context to ensure accurate processing.  
- Added `box` import from shapely for correct geometry operations and spatial consistency.  

#### Automated Output Generation  
- Integrated `save_concatenated_ndwi_with_shapefile()` to automatically save results and generate coastline shapefiles.  
- Created a separate `save_ndwi_plots()` function to export visualization outputs instead of only displaying them.

# 4. Data Preprocessing Pipeline  
![Data Preprocessing Pipeline](images/DATA%20PREPROCESSING%20PIPELINE.png)

### **Step 1: Batch Alignment**  
**Purpose:** Align raw satellite images to a common CRS, pixel size, and extent.  
**Tool:** `GDAL warp` (`batch_align.py`)  
**Input:** 32 raw satellite GeoTIFFs from `raw_data/` + NDWI reference image  

**Process:**  
- Reads configuration and alignment parameters from the reference image  
- Sets alignment parameters:  
  - CRS: UTM Zone 3N (EPSG:32603)  
  - Pixel size: **3.125 m** (medium-resolution NDWI image)  
  - Spatial extent: `[598355.000000, 7326619.000000, 605849.500000, 7334628.500000]`  
- Uses GDAL warp to align CRS, resolution, and extent  

---

### **Step 2: Georeferencing**  
**Purpose:** Apply pixel-level precision correction for spatial alignment.  
**Tool:** `AROSICS` (`georeference.py`)  
**Input:** Aligned images from Step 1 + NDWI base image + Deering Airstrip coordinates  

**Process:**  
- Coregisters aligned images with AROSICS  
- Applies fine spatial corrections for pixel-level accuracy  
- Corrects rotated or tiled images as needed  

**Output:** 32 georeferenced GeoTIFFs (`*_GeoRegistered.tif`)  

---

### **Step 3: Mask Generation**  
**Purpose:** Create binary water/land masks with scientific validation.  
**Tool:** `create_masks.py`  
**Input:** Georeferenced images from Step 2 + transect points shapefile  

**Process:**  
- Computes NDWI from Green + NIR bands  
- Applies Gaussian blur for noise reduction  
- Performs sliding window analysis around transect points  
- Combines local classification with global NDWI threshold  

**Output:**  
- Binary mask TIFFs (`*_concatenated_ndwi.tif`)  
- Coastline shapefiles (`*_Coast_Contour.shp`)  
- Visualization plots (NDWI, mask, summary)

  
![Image-Mask Diagram](images/img_mask_diagram.png)

---

### **Step 4: Image Tiling**  
**Purpose:** Split images and masks into smaller tiles for training.  
**Tool:** `Rasterio` (`tile_images.py`)  
**Input:** Georeferenced images (Step 2) + Masks (Step 3)  

**Process:**  
- Reads raster data with georeferencing  
- Splits into **512√ó512** pixel tiles with overlap  
- Applies identical tiling to both images and masks  

**Output:** ~1,100 tiles (~550 images + ~550 masks)  


![Tile Diagram](images/Tile_Diag.png)

---

### **Step 5: Data Augmentation**  
**Purpose:** Expand dataset with rotated and flipped variations.  
**Tools:** `OpenCV + Rasterio` (`augment_tiles.py`)  
**Input:** Image‚Äìmask tile pairs from Step 4  

**Process:**  
- Reads each tile pair  
- Generates rotated & flipped variations (**7 augmentations**)  
- Preserves georeferencing metadata  

**Output:** ~8,800 tiles (1,100 original + 7,700 augmented)  

![Augmentation Diagram](images/augment_Diagram.png)

### **Training Dataset Statistics**  
- **Batch Alignment:** 32 images  
- **Georeferencing:** 32 images  
- **Mask Generation:** 5 selected georeferenced images ‚Üí 5 binary masks  
- **Image Tiling:**  
  - 110 tiles per image √ó 5 images = 550 image tiles  
  - 110 tiles per mask √ó 5 masks = 550 mask tiles  
  - **Total = 1,100 image‚Äìmask tiles**  
- **Data Augmentation:**  
  - 1,100 original tiles √ó 8 versions (1 original + 7 augmented)  
  - **= 8,800 tiles (4,400 images + 4,400 masks)**

## What I Did This Summer  
For my GSoC project this year, I focused on preparing a **high-quality dataset using PlanetLabs imagery** so that I could train different models such as [DeepWaterMap](https://github.com/isikdogan/deepwatermap) and also experiment with other models like **U-Net**. A large part of my work involved extensive data preprocessing tasks, which were essential for building a reliable training pipeline. I‚Äôll try to summarize the work that I did in my GSoC project below. Let‚Äôs get started!
